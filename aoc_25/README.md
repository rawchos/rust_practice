# Advent of Code 2025

Solutions to puzzles described by the Advent of Code 2025.

## Notes

* Input files should be stored in the `resources/aoc_25` directory and follow this naming pattern: `resources/aoc_25/day_[dd].txt`
  * Ex: `resources/aoc_25/day_01.txt`
* The `resources` directory is ignored so input files won't be added to the repo
