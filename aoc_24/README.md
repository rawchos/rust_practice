# Advent of Code 2024

Solutions to puzzles described by the Advent of Code 2024.

## Notes

* Input files should be stored in the `resources/aoc_24` directory and follow this naming pattern: `resources/aoc_24/day_[dd].txt`
  * Ex: `resources/aoc_24/day_01.txt`
* The `resources` directory is ignored so input files won't be added to the repo
